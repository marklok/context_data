Basic information

\n\nHuman: What is personal data?\n\nAssistant: Personal data is information that relates to an individual. That individual must be identified or identifiable either directly or indirectly from one or more identifiers or from factors specific to the individual.

\n\nHuman: Is name personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Name and last name would be considered personal data under GDPR.

\n\nHuman: Is age personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Age would be considered personal data if there’s a risk that you can identify someone from the age alone. A number alone wouldn’t be considered personal data.

\n\nHuman: Is address personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes, if the address can be related to an individual.

\n\nHuman: Is job title personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes, if the job title can be related to an individual.

\n\nHuman: Is email address personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Personal email address will usually be considered personal data.

\n\nHuman: Is national ID number personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes. ID numbers will usually be considered personal data.

\n\nHuman: Is IP address personal data?\n\nAssistant: Usually yes, but in some cases when you’re not using your own network, the IP address can not be considered to be personal data.

\n\nHuman: Is location data personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Location data can even be considered to be sensitive data if combined with other data sources - like location data leading to a hospital.

\n\nHuman: Is phone number personal data?\n\nAssistant: Yes, if its the phone number of a person.

\n\nHuman: What is sensitive personal data?\n\nAssistant: Some of the personal data you process can be more sensitive in nature and therefore requires a higher level of protection. The UK GDPR refers to the processing of these data as ‘special categories of personal data’. This means personal data about an individual’s:
race;
ethnic origin;
political opinions;
religious or philosophical beliefs;
trade union membership;
genetic data;
biometric data (where this is used for identification purposes);
health data;
sex life; or
sexual orientation.

\n\nHuman: What is processing?\n\nAssistant: Processing means taking any action with someone’s personal data. This begins when a data controller starts making a record of information about someone, and continues until you no longer need the information and it’s been securely destroyed. If you hold information on someone, it counts as processing even if you don’t do anything else with it.

\n\nHuman: Is saving data considered processing?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Any action with someone’s personal data is considered processing under the GDPR.

\n\nHuman: Is accessing data considered processing?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Any action with someone’s personal data is considered processing under the GDPR.

\n\nHuman: What is a data controller?\n\nAssistant: A data controller has the responsibility of deciding how personal data is processed and protecting it from harm. Controllers aren’t usually individual people. They can be a limited company, an organisation, charity, association, club, volunteer group or business of any size – including sole traders and people who work for themselves.

\n\nHuman: I don’t understand data controller\n\nAssistant: A data controller has the responsibility of deciding how personal data is processed and protecting it from harm. Controllers aren’t usually individual people. They can be a limited company, an organisation, charity, association, club, volunteer group or business of any size – including sole traders and people who work for themselves.

\n\nHuman: What is a data processor?\n\nAssistant: Data processors have to protect people’s personal data and they only process it in the first place on behalf of the controller. They wouldn’t have any reason to have the data if the controller hadn’t asked them to do something with it. A data processing agreement has to be in place as part of this arrangement.

\n\nHuman: What is legal basis?\n\nAssistant: A legal basis is the reason or legal grounds you can rely on for using people’s personal data. There are six bases to choose from:
consent;
contract;
legal obligation;
vital interests;
public task; and
legitimate interests.

\n\nHuman: What is lawful basis?\n\nAssistant: A lawful basis is the reason or legal grounds you can rely on for using people’s personal data. There are six bases to choose from:
consent;
contract;
legal obligation;
vital interests;
public task; and
legitimate interests.

\n\nHuman: How do I use consent?\n\nAssistant: Some types of processing are carried out on the basis that you have given your consent. Under the GDPR, consent to processing must be freely given, specific, and informed. You cannot be forced to give your consent, you must be told what purpose(s) your data will be used for, and you should show your consent through a ‘statement or as a clear affirmative action’ (e.g. ticking a box).

\n\nHuman: How do I use contract?\n\nAssistant: This legal basis can only apply to contracts between the actual data subject and the controller. Controllers need to be aware that to rely on a contractual legal basis for processing personal data it isn’t sufficient for the processing to just be somehow related to the contractual relationship, instead it must go further and be ‘necessary for the performance’ of that contract.

\n\nHuman: How do I use legal obligation?\n\nAssistant: This legal basis, also known as ‘compliance with a legal obligation’, is likely to be the appropriate legal basis in cases where controllers are obliged to process the personal data to comply with EU or local legislation. You must assess whether processing is actually ‘necessary’ in order to comply with that obligation.

\n\nHuman: What are individual rights?\n\nAssistant: In data protection law, people have rights over their data. These generally allow them to ask you to do something, or stop doing something, with their personal data. There are eight individual rights. If you’re handling people’s personal data, you’ll have to comply with these rights whenever they’re used, unless it’s an exceptional situation. 

As a small business or SME, the three main rights you’re likely to come across are the right of access, the right to object and the right to be informed:

The right of access is when someone asks you for a copy of the data you have on them. This is also known as a subject access request - or SAR – and you have one month to deal with a SAR.
The right to object means people can object to specific processing of their personal data, so you’d have to stop using their data for certain purposes unless you have a good reason to continue. For example, if a customer objects to you using their details to send them postal marketing, you could suppress or flag their details so you know not to post them marketing material again.
The right to be informed usually means that you have to tell people that you have their data and what you’re doing with it.

Furthermore there are rights like
The right to rectification
The right to erasure
The right to restrict processing
The right to data portability
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling

\n\nHuman: What is security of processing?\n\nAssistant: Data security doesn’t have to cost the earth, but any business that wants to be trusted has to get it right.
Simple security measures could include:
storing paperwork in a locked cabinet or container;
making sure your door and window locks are working and used;
never leaving anything in a vehicle unattended;
putting strong passwords on all of your devices;
keeping your system’s anti-virus software up-to-date;
separating your business email account from your personal email account, rather than using the same one; and
being extra vigilant when sending or receiving emails – to help prevent sophisticated phishing attempts and scams.

\n\nHuman: Can I transfer data to countries outside the EU?\n\nAssistant: Yes, if the country is considered secure (based on a so called adequacy decision). These currently count Andorra, Argentuna, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Israel, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, Great Britain, South Korea, Uruguay. Furthermore, personal data can be transferred to countries like Australia, Canada, the US and Japan if certain requirements are met.

\n\nHuman: What are these requirements?\n\nAssistant: Personal data can be transferred to:
Australia if the personal data concerns flight passangers
Canada if the receiver is under the PIPEDA act
USA if the personal data concerns flight passangers
Japan if the transfer is to companies that fall under the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information.

Company specific

\n\nHuman: I want to use Microsoft as a vendor \n\nAssistant: What Microsoft product do you want to use?

\n\nHuman: I want to use Microsoft 365 \n\nAssistant: Ok. Microsoft 365 have some standard conditions you have to be aware of. For example they might need to transfer data to the US which doesn’t align with your companys policy on the area. Have you discussed this with the DPO?

\n\nHuman: Yes. The DPO says its fine \n\nAssistant: Ok. Then I’ll make a draft assessment based on the input that you give me. I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
